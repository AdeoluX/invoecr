# üìÑ InvoicePro Africa - Business Plan & Strategy

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Product**: Mobile-first invoice generator built specifically for African SMEs, freelancers, and businesses

**Primary Market**: Nigeria (largest market, high fintech adoption)
**Revenue Model**: Freemium + Subscription + Transaction fees
**Target Revenue**: ‚Ç¶37.5M/year (~$25,000) in Year 1

## üåç Market Analysis

### Problem Statement

- **80-90% of African businesses are SMEs/freelancers** who don't use proper invoicing tools
- Most rely on Word, Excel, or handwritten receipts

- Fragmented payments: Bank transfers, POS, mobile money, cash, Paystack/Flutterwave
- Complex taxation: VAT, PAYE, different state requirements overwhelm SMEs

### Market Opportunity

  - Service providers (tailors, salons, caterers, mechanics)
  - Small agencies (digital marketing, creative, IT)
